This will be the new home for a blog that I created.  

I built it originally in WordPress, but I want to get away from that and into building it a new way.

Will need to create an "admin page" that will allow me to enter posts and send to database.

Also, need to look into possibly adding google analytics to admin page.  That is something I have not looked into, but should check to see if I could make it happen.
